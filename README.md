## Why This Project?

This project was built to showcase a strong understanding of core React concepts and the ability to create a polished, real-world application. It serves as a practical example of building a full-featured frontend application from scratch, with a focus on code quality, user experience, and maintainability—qualities that are essential in a professional development environment.

## Features

- **Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Tasks**: Full task management functionality.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` to ensure data is not lost on refresh.
- **Status Filtering**: Filter tasks by `All`, `Completed`, or `Pending` status.
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle animations for adding and removing tasks to improve UX.
- **Responsive Design**: A mobile-first design that looks great on any screen size.
- **Form Validation**: Prevents the submission of empty tasks.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The programming language used for the application logic.
- **CSS Modules**: For scoped, component-level styling to avoid class name conflicts.
- **React Hooks**: For state management and side effects in functional components.
